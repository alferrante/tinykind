# TinyKind Product Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-02-19

## Vision
Make expressing gratitude effortless, personal, and repeatable.

## Inputs Shaping This Roadmap
- User feedback: “I already want it to integrate with my contact list and photo album to come up with super personalized stuff (maybe a premium feature).”

## Now (0-4 weeks)
- Stabilize core delivery reliability.
  - Ensure links do not disappear unexpectedly.
  - Add basic admin visibility for submissions and failures.
- Improve sender UX.
  - Better input validation and clearer error states.
  - Strong success state with one-tap copy/share actions.
- Add sender history (private).
  - Show sent TinyKinds and latest reactions in one place.

## Next (1-2 months)
- Contact list integration.
  - Import recipient name + preferred channel from address book.
  - Quick-select “frequent recipients.”
- Smarter personalization (free baseline).
  - Reuse previous context for the same person (“last thanked for…”).
  - Suggest lightweight message starters from prior notes.
- Weekly reminder system.
  - Configurable day/time.
  - One-click start from reminder to compose flow.

## Later (2-4 months)
- Photo-aware personalization (Premium candidate).
  - Optional photo album signal (recent memories, events) to suggest more specific gratitude prompts.
  - Sender-controlled permissions and opt-in only.
- Rich TinyKind experiences.
  - Themed reveal styles.
  - Optional voice note + auto-transcript polish.
- Reply loop improvements.
  - “Send one back” with prefilled context.

## Premium Packaging Candidates
- Contacts + intelligent recipient insights.
- Photo-based personalization suggestions.
- Advanced templates + seasonal reveal themes.
- Scheduled campaigns (e.g., weekly/monthly gratitude plans).

## Guardrails (Non-Negotiable)
- Private by default (1:1, no public feed).
- Minimal personal data retention.
- Explicit consent for contacts/photos access.
- Clear controls to delete notes and revoke integrations.

## Open Decisions
- Premium trigger: feature gating vs usage limits.
- Storage model for personalization memory (local-only vs cloud profile).
- Whether contact/photo integrations launch on iOS first or cross-platform first.
